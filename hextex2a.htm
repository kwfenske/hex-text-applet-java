<p>This is a Java Swing applet to convert between text characters and decimal
or hexadecimal digits representing those characters.&nbsp; You have several
options for the converted digits: decimal (base 10) or hexadecimal (base
16), 8-bit "plain text" bytes, 16-bit combined words, 16-bit "big endian"
bytes, 16-bit "little endian" bytes, etc.&nbsp; Input characters that are
not valid digits are ignored during conversion and are treated as white
space or separators.&nbsp; Leading zeros may be omitted unless the digits
run together without separators.
<p>The term "big endian" means that a 16-bit number is represented by two
8-bit bytes with the high-order (most significant) byte appearing first.&nbsp;
"Little endian" has the low-order (least significant) byte appearing first:
<p><center><table>
<tr>
<td>16-bit combined word:</td>
<td>&nbsp;</td>
<td>1234 (hex)</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>16-bit "big endian" bytes:</td>
<td></td>
<td>12 34</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>16-bit "little endian" bytes:</td>
<td></td>
<td>34 12</td>
</tr>
</table></center>
<p>Results vary depending upon your browser, your version of Java, and
your system's character set.&nbsp; Note that Java Swing may not allow copy
and paste from the system clipboard, only from within the applet (between
the input and output text areas).

<p><a NAME="java"></a>If this web page begins with an error message saying
that your browser does not support Java, then either your computer doesn't
have Java, or Java is not enabled.&nbsp; If you see an empty rectangle
where the applet should be, then you have Java but need a newer browser
or a newer version of Java.&nbsp; For Internet Explorer 5 or later, Firefox,
Mozilla, and Netscape 7.x or later on Windows, you may download the Sun
Java run-time environment (JRE) from <a href="http://www.java.com/getjava/">http://www.java.com/getjava/</a>
on Sun's web site.&nbsp; This program was written on and tested against
Sun Java 1.4.
<p>The <a href="hextex2c.txt">source code</a> for this applet is available
for inspection.&nbsp; You may also <a href="hextex2d.zip">download the
application</a> as a <a href="freesoft.htm#zip">ZIP archive</a> with the
executable Java class file and the documentation in <a href="freesoft.htm#acrobat">Adobe
Acrobat</a> PDF format.&nbsp; Writing a similar Java program is an assignment
for students.&nbsp; More programming assignments and solutions can be found
on my "<a href="cpindex.htm">Computer Programming Examples</a>" web page.
